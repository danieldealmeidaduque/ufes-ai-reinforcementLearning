## About The Project

<p align="justify">
    The article aims to analyze the reinforcement learning method using a meta-heuristic and a classifier to play the Google Dinosaur game and achieve the maximum possible points. Genetic Algorithm was chosen as the meta-heuristic and Neural Network as the classifier for the reinforcement learning method. After learning, a comparison of results was made using statistical tests: paired t-test and non-parametric Wilcoxon test, between the method developed in this article and the method developed by the Artificial Intelligence course professor, Flávio Miguel Varejão.
